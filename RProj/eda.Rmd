# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Prepare the Dataset

```{r}
games_raw <- read.csv("dataset/games.csv", header=TRUE)
gps_raw <- read.csv("dataset/gps.csv", header=TRUE)
rpe_raw <- read.csv("dataset/rpe.csv", header=TRUE)
wellness_raw <- read.csv("dataset/wellness.csv", header=TRUE)
```

## Glimpse of the Dataset

```{r}
str(games_raw)
str(gps_raw)
str(rpe_raw)
str(wellness_raw)
```

## Pre-processing the Data. 

### Dataset "wellness"

```{r}
wellness_modified <- wellness_raw %>%
    select(-Nutrition, -NutritionAdjustment, -BedTime, -WakeTime)
```

```{r}
# Boxplot of Fatigue and Menstruation
wellness_modified %>% ggplot(aes(x = Menstruation)) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(y = Fatigue))
```


### Dataset "gps"

```{r}
# Get a small dataset version of gps
g1h1p1 <- gps_raw %>% filter(GameID == 1, Half == 1, PlayerID == 2)

# Remove the zero speed and calculate the average speed.
mean((g1h1p1 %>% filter(Speed != 0.0))$Speed)

# Calculate the moving distance in half 1 for player 1
moving_dist <- mean((g1h1p1 %>% filter(Speed != 0.0))$Speed) * 60 * 8 * 45/60
```

Goal: Graph the frames about how player moved in a game. 

```{r}
# Sample game: GameID == 1
game1_data <- gps_raw %>% 
    filter(GameID == 1) %>%
    select()
```

## Challenges

### Challenged #1

```{r}
gps_cleaned <- gps_raw %>%
    select(GameID, Half, PlayerID, FrameID, GameClock, Speed)

wellness_joined <- wellness_raw %>% inner_join(games_raw, by = "Date") %>%
    select(Date, Fatigue, PlayerID)

wellness_joined <- wellness_joined[!duplicated(wellness_joined),]
gps_cleaned <- gps_cleaned %>% inner_join(wellness_joined, by="")
```
